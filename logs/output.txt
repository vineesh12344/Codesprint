While running the code you suggested, I encountered the <class 'TypeError'>:
--- ERROR MESSAGE ---
'dict_values' object is not subscriptable

Please try to resolve this bug, and rewrite the code snippet.

You encountered an error because of trying to access dictionary values in a wrong way. Corrected code is as follow:

```python
warehouseCapacities["Warehouse1"] = warehouseCapacities["Warehouse1"] * 1.5
```
This will increase the capacity of Warehouse1 by 50%. What will happen next is that, the model will take into account this new capacity when trying to find the optimal soluion. Therefore, it may affect the chosen routes, the whole costs and the distribution of the goods.
