What is the impact of supplier1 being able to supply only half the quantity at present?

```python
# Assuming that supplier1 corresponds to "Berth1" in our case
# As we know that supplier1 can supply only half the quantity at present,
# we have to update the capacity of Berth1 to half of its original capacity.

# Update the capacity of Berth1
berthCapacities["Berth1"] = berthCapacities["Berth1"]/2

# Update the model after changing the capacity
berth_constrs["Berth1"].RHS = berthCapacities["Berth1"]
```

This code sets the capacity of Berth1 to half of its original value. `berth_constrs` contains the constraint objects for each berth's capacity in the model. We update the Right Hand Side (RHS) of the berth constraint for Berth1 to reflect the new capacity. After running the optimization with the updated constraints and capacities, you will see the impact on the optimal solution and objective value.

While running the code you suggested, I encountered the <class 'NameError'>:
--- ERROR MESSAGE ---
name 'berth_constrs' is not defined

Please try to resolve this bug, and rewrite the code snippet.

I'm sorry for the confusion. `berth_constrs` won't be accessible outside the function where it was defined. To properly modify the berth capacity, you should redefine and re-optimize the entire model. Here's the code:

```python
# Redefine the berth capacity dict
berthCapacities = dict({
               "Berth1" : 10000/2, # assuming that Berth1 is supplier1, its capacity is halved
               "Berth2" : 20000,
               "Berth3" : 1000,
               "Berth4" : 40000})

# Clear the current model 
model.reset()

# Get the new berth constraints
berth_constrs = model.addConstrs(gp.quicksum(trucks.select('*', berth)) <= berthCapacities[berth] for berth in berthCapacities.keys())

model.update()
model.optimize()
```

In this code snippet:
- We first redefine the `berthCapacities` dict to reflect the reduced capacity of "Berth1" (assuming this is "supplier1"). 
- We then reset the model to clear the current solution. 
- Then, we add the berth capacity constraints to the model, this time with the updated capacities. 
- Finally, we update and re-optimize the model to find the new optimal solution.

               "Berth3" : 1000,
