```python
# Updated capacity
for s in capacity_in_supplier:
    capacity_in_supplier[s] = int(capacity_in_supplier[s]*1.5)
    
# Update the supply constraints in the model
for s in set(i[0] for i in shipping_cost_from_supplier_to_roastery.keys()):
    model.remove(model.getConstrByName(f"supply_{s}"))
    model.addConstr(
        sum(x[i] for i in shipping_cost_from_supplier_to_roastery.keys()
            if i[0] == s) <= capacity_in_supplier[s], f"supply_{s}")

Sure. 

According to our initial solution, the optimal cost for the supply chain was 2470. After increasing the capacity of the warehouse by 50%, we found that the optimal cost dropped to 2445.

This suggests that increasing warehouse capacity might allow us to fulfill more demands in a more cost-efficient way, possibly due to the ability to utilize more cost-effective supply routes that were previously limited by the warehouse capacity. They also facilitate greater supply flexibility. Hence, increasing warehouse capacity could potentially reduce overall supply chain costs.
