While running the code you suggested, I encountered the <class 'NameError'>:
--- ERROR MESSAGE ---
name 'm' is not defined

Please try to resolve this bug, and rewrite the code snippet.
--- NEW CODE ---

I apologize for the confusion. My mistake for the misunderstanding. As the variable 'm' is defined later in the code and this chatbot task is operating by adding new code within the substring "# OPTIGUIDE *** CODE GOES HERE", all suggested code snippets should only refer to variables that are defined prior to these substrings and can logically fit within them. To test the model, you first need to optimize the model and then print the objective value.

New code: 

```python
# This code cannot be executed in the current context
# It is suggested to be added after the model has been optimized
print(f'Optimal objective value: {m.objVal}')
```
